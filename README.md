# Java Programs  
This repository houses the Java programs that I have developed to demonstrate my understanding of key programming concepts and techniques. These programs cover a wide range of topics, such as object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and file handling. Additionally, the repository reflects my progress and growth in mastering Java programming.  

## Running the Programs  
These programs have been tested on both Linux and Windows operating systems.  

To execute a Java program, navigate to the directory containing the `.java` file and run the following commands:  

1. Compile the program:  
   ```bash  
   javac ProgramName.java  
   ```  

2. Execute the program:  
   ```bash  
   java ProgramName  
   ```  

These programs have been successfully tested using IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse on Windows 11, but you are welcome to use any IDE or text editor of your choice.  

## Contact
